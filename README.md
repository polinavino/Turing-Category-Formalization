# Turing-Category-Formalization
Coq formalization of Turing categories and related concepts

These Coq code files make use of the library formalizing Category theory, found at :
https://bitbucket.org/amintimany/categories/

In order to compile these files, this library must be compiled first. However, the code in the files currently contains absolute loadpaths and cannot be compiled as they are. Furthermore, these code files are a work in progress and there are unfinished proofs I am currently working on. I have put them up to illustrate the code my thesis proposal is referring to.
