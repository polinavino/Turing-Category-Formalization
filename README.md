# Turing-Category-Formalization
Coq formalization of Turing categories and related concepts

These Coq code files make use of the library formalizing Category theory, found at :
https://bitbucket.org/amintimany/categories/

In order to compile these files, this library must be compiled first. However, the code in the files currently contains absolute loadpaths and cannot be compiled as they are.
